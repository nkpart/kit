0.7.13
-----
* Added support for Mac OS X kits

0.7.7
-----
* No longer crashes Xcode when a new kit project is generated.
* Removes old build settings that were causing build warnings.
* Bumps things to Xcode 4.2

0.7.6
-----
- Fixes a bug in dependency resolution if a kit existed in dev-packages, but was not in the cache.

0.7.5
-----

*scene missing*

0.6.3
-----
* Resource directories. KitSpec field: resources-directory, default "resources". This 
  directory is symlinked to Kits/Resources/<package-name> on an update. It gives a 
  stable path to resources that need to be referenced in a parent project (data models,
  images, etc.)

* [BUG] Fixes bug introduced in 0.6.2, which caused the Prefix.pch to be compiled twice 
  (once as C, once as Obj-C).

0.6.2
-----
* Allow 'tagging' of kits as they're published. 
    $ kit publish-local --tag=-HEAD
  Assuming the Kitspec currently specifies version '1.0', this will publish it as '1.0-HEAD'

0.6.1
-----
* [BUG] On error, will now use a failure exit code.

0.6.0
---------
* KitSpec file is now parsed as YAML. Because it's a superset of JSON,
  this is backwards compatible.

0.5.2
-----

* Source and lib directories are configurable: source-directory, lib-directory 
* Static libs can be linked into a kit. Place them in `lib` (or lib-directory).
* You can pass Xcode flags to the Kits when they are compiled. See
	`kitdeps-xcode-flags`. Contents of this string should be in xcconfig format.
